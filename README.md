# Morse Tool

Generates the equivalent morse code for a given text string (. for dot, and - for dash). Controls at the bottom allow for changing the frequency of the morse tone produced, as well as the playback speed in words per minute.

The URL translator is very experimental. Odd coding on an HTML page will do weird things to the output.

JavaScript front-end with PHP for some back-end work, mostly to do with the URL tool.
